# 🎯 RISK SCORE - SIMPLE EXPLANATION

The **Risk Score** is a **0-100 percentage** that tells buyers how likely a listing is a **scam or fraudulent**. It's a trust indicator.

## HOW IT'S CALCULATED

Think of it like a **red flag counter**. Each red flag adds points:

| Red Flag | Points Added | Why? |
|----------|--------------|------|
| **No photos** | +15 | Scammers often don't provide real photos |
| **Each scam report** | +10 per flag | Other users marked it as suspicious |
| **Seller not verified** | +20 | Unverified sellers are higher risk |
| **No vet documents** (paid animals) | +10 | Legitimate sellers provide health docs |
| **Brand new seller** (< 7 days) | +10 | New accounts are riskier |
| **Too many "sold" relists** (>10) | +15 | Pattern of repeated selling suggests fraud |

**Maximum score: 100** (very risky)

## WHAT THE SCORE MEANS

| Score | Status | What to Do |
|-------|--------|-----------|
| **0-20** | ✅ **Safe** | Good to go - Low risk |
| **21-40** | ⚠️ **Caution** | Ask more questions before buying |
| **41-60** | 🚨 **Warning** | Research seller thoroughly |
| **61-100** | ❌ **High Risk** | Avoid or be very careful |

## REAL EXAMPLES

**Listing A: Risk Score = 5**
- ✅ Has photos
- ✅ Seller verified (badge)
- ✅ Seller has been on platform for 1 year
- ✅ Has vet documentation
- = **5 = SAFE**

**Listing B: Risk Score = 65**
- ❌ No photos (-15)
- ❌ Seller not verified (-20)
- ❌ Brand new seller (-10)
- ❌ 15 previous listings marked as sold and relisted (-15)
- ❌ Flagged as suspicious 1 time (-10)
- = **65 = HIGH RISK - AVOID**

---

## ON THE UI

When you see the risk score on the listing detail page:
- **Green badge (0-20):** ✓ Seller looks legitimate
- **Yellow badge (21-40):** ⚠️ Some concerns
- **Red badge (41-100):** 🚨 **HIGH RISK - ⚠️ High Risk** (shown in red)

---

## SUMMARY

**Risk Score is the platform's fraud alert system** to protect buyers from scammers. 

**Higher score = more suspicious the listing.**
