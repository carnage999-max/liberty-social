Below is a clean, build-ready functional spec your developers can execute without interpretation. This is intentionally simple, modular, and scalable.

⸻

Liberty Social — Yard Sale Map Module (YSM)

Purpose: Replace ineffective classifieds and scattered social posts with a dedicated, map-based yard sale discovery system.

⸻

1. Core Concept (Non-Negotiable)
	•	Map-first experience
	•	Radius-based discovery
	•	Yard-sale-only listings
	•	$0.99 paid listing
	•	One-tap navigation + contact

This is not Facebook Marketplace.
This is time-bound, location-specific, hyper-local commerce.

⸻

2. User Flows

A. Buyer / Browser Flow
	1.	User opens Yard Sales section
	2.	Map loads centered on:
	•	GPS location (mobile)
	•	Saved location or IP fallback (web)
	3.	User adjusts search radius slider
	•	Presets: 5 / 10 / 25 / 35 / 50 miles
	4.	Map dynamically updates pins
	5.	User taps a pin → Listing Card
	6.	From card:
	•	Tap Directions → native maps
	•	Tap Call Seller
	•	View hours, dates, items, notes

⸻

B. Seller / Lister Flow
	1.	User taps “Post Yard Sale”
	2.	Simple 1-page form:
	•	Address (auto-geocode)
	•	Sale title
	•	Start date & end date
	•	Daily hours
	•	Description / items
	•	Phone number (optional)
	3.	Pin preview appears on map
	4.	User pays $0.99
	5.	Listing goes live immediately
	6.	Listing auto-expires after end date

⸻

3. Map Behavior (Critical)

Map Engine
	•	Google Maps, Mapbox, or OpenStreetMap (dev choice)
	•	Pins clustered when zoomed out
	•	Pins expand when zoomed in

Radius Logic
	•	Slider dynamically redraws bounding circle
	•	Backend query uses:
	•	Center lat/lng
	•	Radius in miles
	•	Only active listings returned

⸻

4. Listing Data Model (Minimum Viable)

{
  "listing_id": "uuid",
  "user_id": "uuid",
  "title": "Multi-Family Yard Sale",
  "description": "Tools, furniture, kids clothes",
  "address": "123 Main St, Bangor ME",
  "lat": 44.8012,
  "lng": -68.7778,
  "start_date": "2026-06-14",
  "end_date": "2026-06-15",
  "hours": "8am – 2pm",
  "phone": "207-555-1234",
  "price_paid": 0.99,
  "status": "active | expired",
  "created_at": "timestamp"
}


⸻

5. Payment Logic
	•	Flat fee: $0.99 per listing
	•	Stripe or existing Liberty Social payment stack
	•	No subscriptions
	•	No renewals
	•	No free posts

This keeps spam out and signal high.

⸻

6. UI Requirements (Keep It Dumb-Simple)

Map View
	•	Full-screen map
	•	Floating radius slider
	•	Floating “Post Yard Sale” button
	•	Pin colors:
	•	Active = red
	•	Today-only = blue
	•	Multi-day = orange

Listing Card
	•	Title
	•	Address
	•	Dates & hours
	•	Call button
	•	Directions button

No chat. No comments. No likes.

⸻

7. Moderation & Safety
	•	Phone number optional (seller choice)
	•	Auto-expire listings
	•	Report listing button
	•	Rate limiting on posts per user/day

⸻

8. Why This Works (Strategically)
	•	Yard sales are time-critical
	•	Maps beat feeds
	•	People want directions, not comments
	•	$0.99 is friction that filters junk
	•	Hyper-local = high retention

This becomes a seasonal traffic magnet and a local habit-builder for Liberty Social.

⸻

9. Build Order (Suggested)
	1.	Backend listing model + geo-queries
	2.	Map UI + radius filtering
	3.	Listing creation flow
	4.	Payments
	5.	Auto-expiration job
	6.	Web + mobile parity

⸻

10. Expansion Hooks (Future, Not MVP)
	•	Estate sales
	•	Community tag days
	•	“This Weekend” toggle
	•	Print-friendly flyer export
	•	Featured pins ($1.99 boost)

⸻
